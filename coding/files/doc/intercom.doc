Superusers and admins have many extra controlling commands for the
intercom. These are as follows. NOTE: all of these are used from
within intercom mode.

add_server         - This adds a new unknown server to the database. An
                    example of this is:

                    intercom add_server Walt:walt:genesis.skl.com:6969



announce_move      - This allows the admin to change the talkers registered
                    address on all connected talkers.
                    An example of this is:

                    intercom announce_move genesis.skl.com:6969

banish             - This permanently bars a remote talker from connecting to
                    this intercom. This is the equivalent of banishing a
                    character. This may be undone with the unbar command.
                    An example of this is:

                    intercom banish resort



banish_name        - This stops a user from using the intercom. It stops
                    the user at this end from making any outgoing use, and
                    it also stops anyone from another talker with the name
                    from sending any messages into this talker. This is a
                    saved banish, and so will survive reboots and crashes.
                    An example of this is:

                    intercom banish redneck



bar_name           -  This stops a user from using the intercom. It stops
                    the user at this end from making any outgoing use, and
                    it also stops anyone from another talker with the name
                    from sending any messages into this talker. This is not a
                    saved banish, and so will NOT survive reboots and crashes.
                    An example of this is:

                    intercom bar chris



bar                - This temporarily bars a talker from connecting to this
                    intercom. This will stop all connection from that talker
                    to this. An example of this is:

                    intercom bar surfers



change_alias       - Change the alias, name, address and portnumber of a
change_address      talkers entry in the database. This is useful for
change_name         maintenance purposes, for example a talker on the list
change_port         moves, or the alias is too close and too confusing to
                    another talkers alias. An example of this is:

                    intercom change_alias crazylands:crazy



close              - This command completely closes down the intercom to all
                    usage, no external links are retained. An example of this
                    is:

                    intercom close



delete_server      - This completely deletes a server from the database. Note
                    however that if they have us on their database, they
                    will attempt to re-establish connection to us next time
                    their intercom boots, and they will be added to our
                    database as a banished talker. Thus it is only very useful
                    when a talker has been discontinued. An example is:

                    intercom delete_server elsewhere
                  


lsu                - This is NOT an intercom subcommand. Superusers only
                    have the ability to view the SU list on remote talkers.
                    An example of this is:
    
                    lsu @walt



open               - This opens a closed intercom. This is the opposite of
                    intercom close. An example of this is:

                    intercom open



ping               - This attempts to establish a link to a remote server
                    that you believe is up, but is shown as being down on
                    the intercom list. An example of this is:

                    intercom ping cheeseplants



reboot             - If the intercom is not very well, this will reboot it.
                    It will have no other effect on the main talker.
                    An example of this is:

                    intercom reboot



stats              - This views network statistics about any or all of the
                    talkers connected to the intercom. An example of this is:

                    intercom stats
                    intercom stats walt



unbanish_name      - This removes a name from the intercoms list of banished
                    users, allowing two way conversation by that name once
                    again. This negates intercom banish_name. An example of 
                    this is:

                    intercom unbanish athanasius



unbar_name         - Allows a barred name to use the intercom again. This 
                    negates the effect of intercom bar_name. An example of
                    this is:

                    intercom unbar_name terminator



unbar              - This command removes a bar or banish from a talker, and
                    attempts to estabish a link to it. An example of this is:

                    intercom unbar foothills



update_servers     - This requests a list of every talker that every talker
                    we have a link with, has a link with. In other words, it
                    discovers all new talkers in the intercom community. It
                    should only really be done once a week, or once a month,
                    as it is very high bandwidth. An example of this is:

                    intercom update servers


NOTE: Many of the command syntaxes are : separated.This is to allow spaces
in the names of talkers, but do NOT put spaces in talker aliases, or
only who will work with it, and tell and the rest will NOT.

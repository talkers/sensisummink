Quickstart Instructions:

1) cd coding/src
1) edit include/config.h for your system, environment, and required
   options.
2) edit Makefile for your system.
3) make
4) make install
5) ../bin/angel &

Oh, and do remember to strip tested binaries when you're happy that your
program is stable enough to no longer require debug information.
6) strip ../bin/summink

Have fun :-)

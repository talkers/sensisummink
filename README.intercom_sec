The intercom utilises several security measures to ensure no abuse is
possible. However as anyone can log in as a newbie to any talker and
cause havock, so they can to the intercom. The following security measures
are implimented.

Any new server wishing to connect to your intercom for the first time is NOT
automatically allowed access to it. An SU must manually allow them to connect
by unbarring the talker. It is usual to actually connect to that talker and
see if its the sort of talker you WISH to have connecting to yours, before
unbarring it. Once it has been unbarred once, it will not need verifying
again.

Any KNOWN server connecting for the first time in this session is first
checked for authenticity.  Once it has satisfied your intercom it is
authentic, the connection is automatically established.


Any abuse of the intercom from remote sites is countered in many ways.

Firstly, any name banished on your talker will not be able to communicate
through the intercom in any way. Any name that is blocked or ignored on
an individuals normal list will be unable to communicate with that
individual. Lists have been expanded to accept intercom addresses, to allow
specific intercom sites, intercom users, or the intercom as a whole, to
be ignorred by the individual.

For harassment by users from a specific site, the intercom may be closed to
that site specifically, or if there is harassment from many sites, the
intercom may be closed completely, and re-opened when you feel you wish to
do so. 

A specific name harassing users from many sites can be barred from passing
through your intercom from any site.


Thus, in a nutshell, anyone wanting to use it to harass people is going to
have a hard time of it. Banish their name on the talker, on the intercom,
ignore them, their name or their site, close their site, or close the 
whole intercom. All ways of stopping a hassling user.

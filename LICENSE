This is an extended version of the LICENSE file originally bundled with
summink v1.0.  The original file has been included for historical reasons
as 'LICENCE.summinkv1.0'.

By using this code you agree to all the following terms and conditions. These
terms and conditions supercede any others that may have been imposed by
previous versions of the code that were released unless otherwise stated,
and apply to SensiSumminkV3.1.

i) This code is in *NO* way supported by anybody who has ever coded
it. You use it entirely at your own risk, and in doing so agree to indemnify
ALL the people who have contributed coding time against any proceedings that
may result due to the use or misuse of this code. We are *NOT* responsible!

ii) The code is provided on an 'as is' basis. It is not guaranteed to work, or
not to. This could mean it will completely screw up the machine you run it on.
Don't come crying to anyone, we're NOT responsible.

iii) Feel free to redistribute the code. BUT please include all the files, and
make clear any changes you have made to them. By preference point people to
where you got this from, so they can have an unadulterated copy, (that, or YOU
are responsible for any questions they may ask).

iv) If you remove code from the distribution for use in your own code or
programs, you *MUST* credit the authors of the code you use.

v) You MUST give credit to the following people in your message of the day,
(and must always include something like a message of the day for this purpose).

       Simon Marsh      - aka Burble the originator of the code
       Neil Charley     - aka Athanasius, worked on it a lot as Surfers
       James Greenhalgh - aka Slaine, turned Summink into SensiSummink

vi) In a 'help credits' or similar you must also mention the following people:

       Christopher Hughes  - aka Chris, worked on the code as Foothills a bit
		 
       Michael James Simms - aka Grim (he'll hate me for revealing his real
		             name), worked on the code as Surfers.
													after Athanasius left.
       Nicolai Plum        - aka Nicolai (!), worked on the code as Surfers
                             and did a lot of updates to the help files

       Various Warwick Uni (wwk) spods, and everyone else who has contributed
		 in some way. (yes this is a general credit)

(basically you just need to give credit where credit is due)
You may of course credit the entire lot in your message of the day as well,
but you'll end with a rather large one *8-P.

**SensiSummink V2.0 note: If you compile the source with Intercom support
  set, you must also mention "Michael Simms", or "Grim" in your motd or
  'help credits' file as the creator of the Intercom system. 

**SensiSummink V3.1 note: If you compile the source with Ident support, you
  must give credit to Niel Charley (aka Athanasius) and James Hawtin (aka
  Oolon).

vii) The 'summink_version' command -=> MUST <=- be left in the code.  Theres
nothing more annoying for source maintainers than to log in to a talker, and
not know which version the people have.  It seems some people have removed
the command so their talker seems less 'out of the box', but seeing as
almost -every- talker is ew2 based, that seems a little pointless.  Summink
is based on EW2, and SensiSummink is based on that, everyone knows, so
please PLEASE leave the command in place.

viii) You must also comply with the LEGALISE from the 'EW-Too' source
distributed by Burble himself. Here's a copy

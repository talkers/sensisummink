READ THIS!!!

Here is a quick overview of the site types sitecheck/ban/unban will
use/find/understand, along with a small description of them.
NB - n means a number you have to specify, and * is wildcard.

<0.*.*.*>       - non existant, will give you an error.
<1-126.*.*.*>   - Class A subnet.
<127.*.*.*>     - Localhost.
<128-191.n.*.*> - Class B subnet.
<192-223.n.n.*> - Class C subnet.
<224-254.n.n.n> - Reserved address.
<225/*.*.*.*>   - Full wildcard (ie every site).

Whilst ban and unban will require the numbers in 'n' to be specified
(optionally specifying the numbers in *), sitecheck will allow wildcard
values in any position.  This is to stop people banning too many sites by
accident etc.  In addition, when you 'site' an ip, it will be checked only
as stringently as one you would give to sitecheck.  If you 'site' a person,
it will return the people from the same subnet instead of assuming it to be
a Class B as it used to.
